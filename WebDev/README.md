### Training
Prequisite: You should be able to read & write basic java.

You will need to understand & write Swagger APIs. In case, you dont know about them, you can learn it from this course:
  * Udemy Course - [Course about Design First approach with OpenAPI(Swagger) specs and tools](https://www.udemy.com/course/swagger-tools-openapi/). Credentials at the bottom of the page. Please note that other candidates are also using this account, so the Udemy app will not be able to remember which chapter/lecture you were at in the previous learning session. Please note down the lecture number and play time in the lecture when you finish your learning session.

If you don't know about AWS, backend API, serverless paradigm of computing, you can learn it here:
  * You can learn about basics of AWS and how to create one account here by going through first 17 mins of this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubCNZRNjhyo).
  * You can learn about AWS IAM basics from the first 19m 15s of this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjVFf83dcE8).
  * Udemy Course - [Serverless using AWS Lambda for Java Developers](https://www.udemy.com/course/serverless-programming-using-aws-lambda-for-java-developers/). Credentials at the bottom of the page. Please note that other students are also using this account, so the Udemy app will not be able to remember which chapter/lecture you were at in the previous learning session. Please note down the lecture number and play time in the lecture when you finish your learning session.
At the end of these 2 trainings, you will be able to develop any business application in java & deploy it in the cloud.


Extra training for reference and in-depth knowledge of AWS:
  * [Free Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/building-modern-java-applications-on-aws)
    * You can skip week 4 & week 6 as the course material taught in those weeks aren't relevant to the assignment.



### Instructions
* **Starting Point**
    * Go through this blog: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/real-world-serverless-application/
        * It talks about how to build production grade java web applications in AWS Lambda with holistic explanation with an exmaple.
    * Fork out this Github Project: https://github.com/amazon-archives/realworld-serverless-application
        * It will act as the starting point for your application. It has a sample application completely build and working E2E. You can modify this to build your assignment.
    * Go through the Github project's wiki pages:
        * https://github.com/amazon-archives/realworld-serverless-application/wiki
        * https://github.com/amazon-archives/realworld-serverless-application/wiki/Quick-Start
        * https://github.com/amazon-archives/realworld-serverless-application/wiki/Back-end

### Assessment Criteria
1. Meeting ALL criteria (which are not explicitly marked as optional) in the [Instructions](#instructions).
2. Maintainability and organisation of code .
3. Balancing between speed and quality of code - we understand that candidates can only spend limited time on these challenges. If you do make any trade-offs in favour of saving time, do mention them in comments. We do value calculated & well reasoned assumptions.
4. Ownership - going beyond the exact job description to deliver a finished product. Optional elements above provide you a way to get more brownie points assuring success.
5. No submissions to be made with compressed/binary files - all source code should be version controlled and visible in plain text in github. This is essential to our idealogy of public submission by interview candidates, not creating a competitive advantage for EffX employees or organization.

### Submission Process
1. Fork this repository to your personal Github profile
2. Remove all files and folders in the forked repository and start developing your project in it
