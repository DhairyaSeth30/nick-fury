### Assessment Criteria
1. Meeting ALL criteria (which are not explicitly marked as optional) in the [Instructions](#instructions).
2. Maintainability and organisation of code .

4. Ownership - going beyond the exact job description to deliver a finished product. Optional elements above provide you a way to get more brownie points assuring success.
5. No submissions to be made with compressed/binary files - all source code should be version controlled and visible in plain text in github. This is essential to our idealogy of public submission by interview candidates, not creating a competitive advantage for Cygnius employees or organization.
